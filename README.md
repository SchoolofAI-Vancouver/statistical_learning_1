## Installation Requirements

Instead of working in R, as in the book, we will do the applications in Python.

It is recommended that you use either [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true) or [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).

## Resources

The meetup covers Chapter 1 and 2 from the book, *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*. The book can be downloaded [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf), but has been added to this repo, [here](https://github.com/SchoolofAI-Vancouver/statistical_learning_1/blob/master/docs/An%20Introduction%20to%20Statistical%20Learning%20-%20Gareth%20James.pdf), for convenience.

The book gives R application code snippets. However, we will be working in Python. The Python code snippets for the book can be found [here](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python).

## Content Authors

The core content was created by the authors of *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*.
